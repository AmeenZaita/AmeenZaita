I am a computer science student specializing in cybersecurity at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I enjoy dedicating my time to working through capture the flag competitions. Some programming languages include C/C++, Java, and Python. I am also familiar with a few security tools such as Gobuster and Hydra. In my last year of high school, I was awarded a scholarship for being in the top 5% of students. I will continue to improve my skills and work toward many more certifications in the future.
