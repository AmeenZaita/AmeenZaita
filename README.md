I'm a software developer intrigued by developments in Ai. I enjoy dedicating my time to craft useful applications such as an inventory management system. Some technologies include c/c++, java and python. In my last year of highschool I was awarded a scholarhsip for being in the top 5% of students. I am currently studying computer science at the University of Illinois Chicago.
